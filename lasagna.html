       <em>"Sausage and sauerkraut are a palate-pleasing pair, especially 
       in lasagna. My family was a little skeptical when I first served this 
       unusual dish. But in no time, they were clamoring for second helpings."</em>

            cottage cheese mixture and sauerkraut and 3/4 cup Monterey Jack. 
            Repeat layers. Top with the remaining noodles and sausage mixture

        <li>Cover and bake at 350° for 50-60 minutes or until a thermometer
